# Project Vision

## Purpose

Build an interactive presentation app that showcases the Claude Code workflow for developers. This workshop app serves as both:

1. **A teaching tool** - Demonstrates how to use Claude Code effectively with the frontend-dev-toolkit
2. **A meta-example** - The app itself is built using the Claude Code workflow, showing the process in action

## Target Audience

- Developers new to AI-assisted coding
- Teams looking to improve their development workflow
- Anyone curious about Claude Code and the frontend-dev-toolkit

## Workshop Goals

1. **Understand the Workflow** - Visualize the Plan → Implement → Verify → Review cycle
2. **Learn the Commands** - Master `/dev:*`, `/verify:*`, `/review:*`, and `/utils:*` commands
3. **Apply Best Practices** - Learn prompting techniques and context management
4. **See It in Action** - Live demonstration of building features with Claude

## Success Criteria

- Attendees can navigate through all slides using keyboard/mouse
- Workflow diagram clearly shows the development cycle
- Command cards provide actionable information
- Dark theme is visually appealing and easy to read
- App is responsive and works on different screen sizes

## Key Takeaways for Attendees

1. Claude Code accelerates development when used with structured workflows
2. The frontend-dev-toolkit provides battle-tested commands
3. Spec-first development leads to better outcomes
4. Verification steps catch issues early
